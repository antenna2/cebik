  <p>With some half-million licensed operators in the United States, the interests of individuals in the overall opportunities offered by amateur radio vary widely. As a result, there are numerous organizations dedicated to fostering interests and skills in various aspects of the service. Below are links to a few of the ones in which I am a life or long-term member.</p>
  <h3><img src="arrllogo.gif" align="left" width="61" height="123" style="padding-right: 10px;"> <a href="https://www.arrl.org" target="_blank">ARRL</a></h3>
  <p>The American Radio Relay League is the largest membership organization of amateur radio operators in the United States and is viewed informally as the U.S. national amateur organization. It conducts an extensive program of services for members and for the amateur community as a whole, including a wide range of educational activities. The ARRL WWW site contains a wealth of amateur radio and membership information.<br>

  <p>QRP ARCI is the oldest U.S.-based organization devoted exclusively to encouraging the use of low power (5 watts CW, 10 watts P.E.P SSB or lower) on the amateur bands.

QRP operators do perhaps more home brewing (building) of station equipment than almost any other segment of the amateur radio population.<br></p>
