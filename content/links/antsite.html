  These links carry a lot of valuable information and ideas, ranging from antenna fundamentals to advanced topics in antenna design, modeling, feeding, and building. In addition, some provide links to other sites, including manufacturers and dealers. Because URLs change without notification to those linking to them, not all of these links may work at any given time. I shall update links as soon as I receive the appropriate information.<br>

The link is to her course in Modern Antennas in Wireless Telecommunications, which is an excellent survey of many antenna principles and practices. Also available from another link at her site is Theory and Applications in Electromagnetics on the fundamental principles underlying electromagnetic radiation. These courses are designed to be used with texts and lab exercises, but the lectures themselves make a very useful and compact survey of the field. They are heavy in relevant equations that are useful for reference.</p>
  <p>The lectures themselves are in .PDF format, so an Adobe reader is necessary.<br>
