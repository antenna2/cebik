Antenna Books of Interest to QRP Enthusiasts               Version 1.3
                                                         April 3, 1997
Compiled by L. B. Cebik, W4RNL

Contents:  This file contains basic information on antenna books of
especial interest to QRP enthusiasts, but also of interest to all antenna
builders and users.  The listing contains books on Basic Antenna
References and Texts; Wire Antennas; Beam and Yagi Antennas; Quads;
Vertical Antennas; Miscellaneous Antenna Projects; Antenna Testing and
Experimenting; and Transmission Lines and Matching

This list is restricted to books on antennas, because there are so
many of them.  Books on more general aspects of electronics and
operating for QRP enthusiasts  and periodicals of interest to QRP
enthusiasts will be found in separate listings.

Each entry in this book list provides the following information:
author, title, publisher, year of publication, cost, ISBN #, numbers
of pages, and a brief description of the contents.

The individual items in this list are believed to be reasonably
complete and accurate as of the date of this notice.  Corrections and
additions may be e-mailed to me at the listed address.  I shall be
pleased to add to the list any publication omitted if it is of high
interest to QRP operators and builders.  And, of course, I shall be
pleased to correct any errors and update the information listed.

Permission to reproduce this list is hereby granted on condition that
a full reference to its source is included.

Good reading, good building, and good operating to you.

                                                    L. B. Cebik, W4RNL
