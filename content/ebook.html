Electronics Books of Interest to QRP Enthusiasts           Version 1.2
                                                       August 20, 1996
Compiled by L. B. Cebik, W4RNL

Contents:  This file contains basic information on electronics books
of especial interest to QRP enthusiasts.  It lists QRP Operating,
Technique, and History Books; Basic Project Books; Advanced Design and
Text Books; and General Reference Works. These listings provide
something for the beginner through the advanced QRP enthusiast and for
both operators, and designer-builders.

Except for certain basic reference works, the list does NOT include
standard, general interest amateur radio books.  There are many such
works that will be of interest to the QRP enthusiast.  However, some
limit has had to be imposed upon the list to keep it within useful
boundaries.  For this same reason, books on antennas are not included
in this listing:  the number of antenna books of interest to QRP
enthusiasts is too large.

Periodicals of interest to QRP enthusiasts and antenna books of
interest to QRP enthusiasts will be found in separate listings.

Each entry in this book list provides the following information:
author, title, publisher, year of publication, cost, ISBN #, numbers
of pages, and a brief description of the contents.

Special thanks go to DL8MFQ, WA8MCQ, AK0B, W6EMD, N2CX, KC4EWT, N3LSB,
and WA6AHL for their assistance in compiling this list.

The individual items in this list are believed to be reasonably
complete and accurate as of the date of this notice.  Corrections and
additions may be e-mailed to me at the listed address.  I shall be
pleased to add to the list any publication omitted if it is of high
interest to QRP operators and builders.  And, of course, I shall be
pleased to correct any errors and update the information listed.

Permission to reproduce this list is hereby granted on condition that
a full reference to its source is included.

Good reading, good building, and good operating to you.

                                          L. B. Cebik, W4RNL
