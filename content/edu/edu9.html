  <p>The internet contains a wealth of opportunities to enhance the education of prospective hams and new licensees of all ages. The trick is to use it selectively and wisely. Like every other teaching tool, internet resources require careful evaluation, sometimes for deciding whether or not to use one at all, sometimes to find the best use for a good resource.</p>
  <p><b>What's Available on the Web:</b> The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) contains a vast array of personal, commercial, organizational, and informational materials, some strictly text (with or without graphics), some embellished with audio and moving images. As teaching tools, we are most interested is the information available to us. In the amateur radio arena, what we can access would fill a library. Here is a partial list arranged by categories:</p>

  <p>This highly abbreviated listing is derived from one of several "ham link" sites: "AC6V Amateur Radio and DX Reference Guide" <a href="https://www.ac6v.com" target="_blank"><b>(https://www.ac6v.com)</b></a>. The actual main index page fills 4 complete sheets, and even includes separate references for the Wouff-Hong and the Rettysnitch.</p>
  <p>Notice that the ARRL is listed only once in the table. Actually, there are extensive references to the <a href="https://www.arrl.org" target="_blank"><b>ARRL site</b></a>, which has a long index of its own covering virtually every aspect of League activities and services. Not the least of these services are the special ones available to ARRL members.</p>
  <p>With so much available, the big task is becoming familiar with the resources and figuring out how best to use them.</p>
  <p><b>Print Supplements</b>: Some web pages can be downloaded in print form and then reproduced for students as class supplements. Not every web page is suitable for this use. Here are a few cautions to observe.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Be very selective, so that you do not overload the student with paper. Familiarize yourself with a wide variety of selections on any topic so that you can select the very best available.</li>
    <li>2. Evaluate each potential paper supplement for clarity of writing and graphics, relative to the age group and background of the students. The key is to challenge students to increase their knowledge without making the challenge impossible to meet.</li>
    <li>3. Be sure you have permission to use the material. Most folks who place materials on the web are happy for you to use them, but obtain permission, regardless of whether the web page or site contains a copyright notice.</li>
    <li>4. Decide whether it is better to distribute an item to everyone or to keep it in a class reading file--to be handed out when there is a clear need and/or interest.</li>
    <li>5. Recheck the source site periodically for revisions and updates to the material presented. Technical information often requires corrections, while activities and regulatory information is subject to regular revision.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Print reproduction allows an instructor to control student contact with material. Amid the many excellent presentations on various topics, there are items that display misconceptions and errors. Hence, the control afforded by print reproduction can usefully guide students to correct as well as readable material.</p>
  <p><b>Student Browsing</b>: As we approach Y2K, most students are likely to have direct access to the web, whether at home, in school, or through activity centers. This offers the student a special educational dimension beyond ordinary print materials: the excitement of discovering information for himself or herself. At the same time, this new dimension reduces the amount of control an instructor has over the absorption of misinformation or disinformation.</p>
  <p>Despite this danger, the instructor can take a few steps to limit damage and enhance the positive directions of discovery. All are based on having a good familiarity of what is available.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Suggest specific sites with known quantities of good and accurate information--geared to the degree possible to the level and background of the student. Do not just give the student a general ham-link site. (Students will discover these sites fairly quickly.)</li>
    <li>2. Select specific URLs (web page addresses) within sites that take the student to the most relevant material. For example, at my own site-- devoted to antenna theory and practice--there are advanced articles that might not be informative to newcomers. However, there is also a series of articles designed for relative beginners, and one can directly access this series. (For example, <b><a href="../gup/groundup.html">Antennas From the Ground Up</a></b> leads directly to the while bypassing the main index page.)
    </li>
    <li>3. Encourage students to discuss with you what they have been reading on the web, and to give you the web site address. This offers you the opportunity to supplement the material, to help the student see its relevance and application, and to overcome errors and misinterpretations. The web materials should be only a start toward productive conversations.</li>
    <li>4. Offer the student additional or alternative web pages to investigate relative to those he or she brings to you.</li>
    <li>5. Relate the web site material directly to licensing and other classroom materials at hand to reinforce important ideas and concepts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ultimately, the existence of general ham-link sites cannot be hidden. Therefore, it is better to approach them head-on, informing students of typical URLs. However, also offer guidelines for their use, lest the student get caught in a maze of links that interferes with the learning process. Show them how to extract useful information without printing everything in sight. Let them bring one or two key pieces of information to class for individual or group discussion. Help them to distinguish casual interesting reading from useful reference material. Reference material may not be just technical or regulatory information, but as well may include how hams live and operate around the world. This latter type of data can be useful when students make their first DX contacts.</p>
  <p>In short, teach students to be as selective in their web browsing and searches as you are.</p>
  <p><b>Lists, Chatrooms, and New Groups</b>: Whether in paper or on-line form, web sites are generally one-way instruments of teaching and learning--from the site to the student. Interaction is largely after the fact in the form of student-teacher or classroom discussion. When not in class, students often want to pose questions or share information. Lists, chatrooms, and news groups offer three different opportunities for doing so.</p>
  <p>Chatrooms are web creations for real-time conversations. News groups and distribution lists are e-mail creations that allow conversation on a somewhat slower basis, but still with less than a 1-day turn-around in most instances.</p>
  <p>Of the three conversational modes, the distribution list is, in my experience, the most productive for learning. Some lists are monitored, which means that inappropriate subject matter and behavior are detected and corrected. Some lists are moderated, so that inappropriate material is blocked from the list. These practices tend to reduce the occurrence of "flame wars" and other distractions from the main purposes of each list. Hence, the level of information transfer tends to be much higher than on other conversational modes.</p>
  <p>The means by which a student becomes part of a distribution list is by e-mail subscription to the "listserver" or the "majordomo" of the list. One list of special note is QRP-L, a list once based at the lehigh.edu site. Since the list has moved, it is used here only as a sample of procedures that may vary slightly from one list to another. QRP-L focused on QRP activities and construction and afford subscribers a chance to ask question and pass along news to other subscribers. It is one of the best places for relative beginners to HF operation to ask questions about equipment and antennas, although holding to the low-power focus is important as well. We may use this list as an example of how a distribution list works.</p>
  <p>In this example, the message data is shown in capital letters for clarity, although either upper or lower case will do in the real message. Sentence ending punctuation has been omitted so that it will not be confused with punctuation used within the addresses and message texts. To subscribe to this list, an individual sends a message to LISTSERV@LEHIGH.EDU using no subject line and only a simple text (here using my information as an example): SUBSCRIBE QRP-L LB CEBIK W4RNL</p>
  <p>The procedure might vary a bit from list to list, and some lists may have a confirmation procedure (to exclude commercial automated advertising systems from mass distributing advertisements on the list). Once subscribed, the individual should read carefully and keep at hand the welcome message, which will contain any procedural rules and limits to be observed. To send a message to the group, use the list address, in this case QRP-L@LEHIGH.EDU The automated list server distributes a copy of the message to everyone who subscribes. On active lists, replies begin to emerge almost immediately. Some may go to the entire list. Others will come directly to the person who posed the question.</p>
  <p>Lists require special attention to courtesies, such as not simply including the original message in the reply message. That maneuver wastes reader time and mail-box space. Also important are staying within the subject area of the list and speaking respectfully in all messages.</p>
  <p>There are numerous special interest distribution lists, such as ANTENNAS and TENTEN-L. As the student refines his or her interests, other lists will become attractive as a place to be helped and to render help from one's own experiences, not to mention sharing both achievements and hard-won lessons.</p>
  <p>This very brief introduction to the teaching and learning opportunities available on the internet cannot do justice to what is available. Nor can this note cover all the points of guidance that an instructor should give to students in order to make their internet ventures both pleasant and productive. However, if the ideas here capture only a little bit of your attention and interest, then you may already be headed down a road of new opportunities in teaching the next generation of radio amateurs.</p>
