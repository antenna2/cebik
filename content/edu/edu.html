  <p>Some 35 years of teaching have given me an abiding interest in the continuing education of radio amateurs. As an Educational Advisor to the ARRL, I have prepared since 1992 an article for each of the annual <i>Proceedings of the National Education Workshop</i>. Because these volumes do not see a wide circulation, and because the articles I have contributed might have a useful note or two within them, I am placing them here. Readers should make an attempt to look through the entire contents of the series for other very useful and insightful articles, full of tips and techniques to make ham teaching--both before and after licensing--more effective.</p>
  <p>A number of the articles contain references to web sites, periodicals, vendors, clubs, and other sources having addresses. Such information grows stale and outdated fairly quickly. However, ARRL and <i>QST</i> are 2 enduring sources for updated information. Web search engines are another good source of what is current.</p>

  <p>The availability of on-line information varies with time, with some sites appearing and others disappearing. One of the more durable and useful sites is the following one from Australia;</p>
