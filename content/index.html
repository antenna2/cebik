  <p>At present, this portion of the site contains the complete set of selections from my notebooks, called <i><b>Tales and Technicals</b></i>. Besides a few notes on the history of radio work and some other semi-technical oddities, the collection contains information of interest to radio amateurs and professionals interested in antennas, antenna modeling, and related subjects, such as antenna tuners and impedance matching. My notebooks are geared to helping other radio amateurs and antenna enthusiasts discover what I have managed to uncover over the years and then to go well beyond.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="classes/aids.html">Antenna Modeling Aids</a></strong></p>
  <p>Until now, there has been no systematic introduction to antenna modeling. To correct this lack I have prepared a book, <i><b>Basic Antenna Modeling: A Hands-On Tutorial</b></i>, for Nittany-Scientific's NEC-Win Plus NEC-2 antenna modeling software. The volume can be used as a college text, a seminar manual, or as a self-study guide. The book contains models in .NEC format for over 150 exercises. Since the principles in the book apply to any modeling software, I have also created the same exercise models in the EZNEC format as a separate product. The book and the .nec models are available on the Antenna Modeling Aids page.</p>
  <p>In addition, to answer the needs of those wishing to have a significant collection of models to study or to use as the foundation for further design or analysis work, I have prepared sets of models in both .EZ and .NEC formats. These models, comprising 7 sets of over 100 models each.</p>
  <p>For more advanced modelers using either NEC-2 or NEC-4, I have prepared an additional volume, <i><b>Intermediate Antenna Modeling: A Hands-On Tutorial</b></i>, based on Nittany-Scientific's NEC-Win Pro and GNEC. The volume includes hundreds of antenna models used in the text to demonstrate virtually the complete command set (along with similarities and differences) used by both cores. An analytical table of contents and a sample chapter are available at the NSI site, found on the "Books" page.</p>
  <p>The books and its models, and information about antenna modeling programs are available on the Antenna Modeling Aids page.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="bookant.html">Antenna Books</a></strong></p>
  <p>I have written a few books for amateur radio operators and for antenna enthusiasts. They are listed on the linked page, with further links to their sources.</p><br>
