  <p>My collection of larger (more than 2 elements) multi-band quads is fairly small, consisting of about 3.5 models. However, since one of them is of a 3.5 element 5-band quad, perhaps the score is even. Let's see how this works out.</p>
  <p>First, I have modeled one of the multi-band quads from recent editions of the <i>ARRL Antenna Book</i> (page 2-12 in the 17th Edition). The antenna is a 4- element 3-band quad on a 40' boom. I count it as 1.5 models, since I have modeled is in both #14 and #12 AWG copper wire. The results, especially in light of my notes on wire size in monoband quads, are interesting.</p>
  <p>Next, ON7NQ has shared a number of models with me in his efforts to improve the performance of a commercial 3-element 5-band quad on an 18' boom. One model of note simply adjusts the sizes of virtually all of the loops. A second model adds 2 new elements--new drivers for 10 and 12 meters--making approximately a 3.5 element quad--all on the same 18' boom.</p>
  <p>In looking at these models, we should note a number of things. First and most obvious is the standard set of performance parameters that we have surveyed for all of the quads: free space gain in dBi, 180-degree front- to-back ratio in dB, and VSWR to some specified resistive impedance value. In addition to these matters, we may also wish to note how 3- and 4-element quads are similar to and differ from 2-element multi-band quads in various characteristics. Finally, we may also wish to record some factors related to boom length--at least so far as this small sample of models might suggest about the question.</p>
  <p>As in all other cases, modeling has been done on NEC-4. The conventions of segmentation used in earlier multi-band quads are repeated here. For each side of a given quad loop, there are 7 segments on 10 meters, 9 segments on 12, 11 segments on 15, 13 segments on 17, and 15 segments on 20. Within practical limits, this scheme approaches the goal of having equal length segments throughout the model. Nonetheless, at least one model will have 724 segment distributed on 68 wires. Although NEC-2 will provide results as accurate as NEC-4 for these models, some implementations are limited to 500 segments and may prove less than fully adequate for the modeling task. MININEC results are also accurate if care is taken to ensure element length segment tapering at each corner of each loop. Without the use of symmetry or core enlargement, however, some of these models may be too large for some available versions of MININEC to handle.</p>
  <p>As with past multi-band quads, only 20, 15, and 10 meters will undergo frequency sweeps. The 2 WARC bands (17 and 12) are so narrow that antenna performance characteristics do not significantly vary from their mid-band values. Each wide band will be divided into 10 equal segments. On 20, each segment is 0.35 MHz wide, on 15 each is 0.45 MHz wide, and on 10 each is 0.1 MHz wide. Hence, the graphs cover all of 20 and 10 meters and the first MHz of 10 meters.</p>
  <h3>4-Element 3-Band Quads</h3>In recent editions of the <i>ARRL Antenna Book</i>, there is a 3-band, 4-element quad design attributed to W0AIW. It uses a 40' boom, with all elements (20 through 10 meters) equally spaced at 10' intervals. <b>Fig. 67</b> provides an outline sketch of the antenna.

  <p>These loop lengths are very close to those used in one commercial quad using a shorter boom for a 3-element version. The change from band-to-band appears to be a matter of simple loop length scaling. The elements are shorter than the monoband loop lengths recommended in Orr and Cowan for 3- and 4-element quads. For reference, here is a model description.</p>

  <p>The model has 48 wires and 528 segments. However, modeling time can be reduced by judicious use of the copy function for identical loops and by symbolic coordinate entries, if available. The source wires for each band are as follows: 20m = wire 41; 15m = wire 25; and 10m = wire 9. Source placement is at the wire center.</p>
  <p>Because small changes in wire size resulted in noticeable differences in the antenna performance across the bands in question with monoband quads, I modeled this antenna using both #14 and #12 AWG copper wire. Only the #14 model is shown, since wire size is the only difference between the models.</p>
  <p>As a handy reference, the following table lists the mid-band performance for each band of each version of the antenna.</p>
  <pre>Wire-     Freq.     Gain      F-B       Impedance

#12-10               8.93      8.0      103.0 - j35.8</pre>
  <p>The differences in performance figures are almost completely insignificant. This fact suggests that element interaction among loops for the various bands may play a stronger role in determining performance characteristics in this 3-band model than modest changes in wire size. The closest loop set to an uninfluenced set is for 20 meters, and the differences in mid-band performance are greatest on that band. The performance curves across the bands bear out this suggestion.</p>

  <p>The gain curves in <b>Fig. 68</b> show the virtual identity of the 10-meter gain for the two wire sizes. 15-meter gain does almost as well, and only 20-meter gain shows something interesting. The low-end increase in gain toward the peak value is slightly steeper for the fatter wire.</p>
  <p>A rising gain curve across the band is natural for virtually any parasitic beam having a director and is the opposite trend from that shown by 2-element reflector-driver designs. However, the 10-meter curve strongly suggests that the performance for this band has not been optimized. The dimensions for 10-meters suggest that the design technique used to arrive at the dimension was simple scaling of the loop length from 20 and 15 meter. The result is, according to the model, relatively mediocre performance at the low end of 10 meters for a long-boom 4-element array.</p>

  </center>
  <p>The front-to-back ratio curves in <b>Fig. 69</b> tend to confirm that--if the model is reasonably accurate--inadequate attention has been paid to 10 meter dimensions. The front-to-back ratio on that band only rises above 10 dB at about 28.6 MHz and continues to climb toward the 29.0 MHz mark, where the scan ceased. In contrast, the front-to-back peaks for both 20 and 15 meters occur within the passband under study. In accord with the suggestion that the 20 meter loops are least affected by the other loops in the array--in other words, act most like a monoband array--the 20-meter front-to-back curves show a frequency displacement that is missing from the 15- and 10-meter curves.</p>

  </center>
  <p>The VSWR curves in <b>Fig. 70</b> are also revelatory. The 20-meter mid-band values suggested that the array might have a low SWR relative to 50 Ohms across that band. However, the curves show that SWR climbs precipitously below mid-band, as the resistive component of the source impedance approaches 20 Ohms. Although the mid-band impedance given for 15 meters suggests a better match to 75-Ohm line, the 50-Ohm SWR remains below 2:1 across that band. On 10 meters, the SWR only approaches 2:1 at 29 MHz. However, if the dimensions of all the 10 meter loops were changed to bring the performance reports within the pass band, it is likely that the 10-meter SWR would also decrease to a more acceptable set of values relative to 50 Ohms.</p>
  <p>For reference, here is a table of source impedance values for each band, using the #14 model, recorded for the low, middle, and high points of each band.</p>

  <p>Above 29 MHz, the 10-meter impedance descends once more. It is likely that judicious loop alteration can bring the source impedance within a 2:1 50- Ohm SWR curve that occupies most of the first MHz of 10. Likewise, adjustment to the 20 meter driver length could also move its 2:1 SWR curve lower in the band. There is no reason to touch anything on 15, except perhaps to draw the front-to-back curve more symmetrically within the band.</p>
  <h3>A 3-Element 5-Band 18'-Boom Quad Array</h3>Correspondence with ON7NQ brought to light his efforts to improve the performance of a commercial 3-element 5-band quad he had purchased. The initial dimensions--with allowance for adding 17 and 12 meters and for dropping one element--were similar to those in the 4-element quad just studied. Improvements to 20 meter low-end performance and overall 10-meter performance were the goals of the revisions. Although ON7NQ modeled with a MININEC product, my cross checks with his numbers via NEC-4 showed a very close correlation. The results of one direction of the work yielded the 3- element array sketched in <b>Fig. 71</b>.

  <p>Compared to the dimensions given for the 3-band quad, 15 meters changes scarcely at all. In the case of both 20 and 10 meters, the loops have been enlarged, with the exception of the 20-meter director, which was decreased. The model for this 60-wire, 660 segment model follows.</p>

The source wires are 20m = wire 53, 12m = wire 41, 15m = wire 29, 17m = wire 17, and 10m = wire 5. Dimensions are in inches in the model description. The wire size is #14 AWG copper.</p>

  <p>Relative to the 40' boom 4-element array, gains are down, but each band shows a good match at center to a 50-Ohm feed system. A closer look at each parameter across the wide bands may be useful in understanding the design goals of this model.</p>

  </center>
  <p>As shown in <b>Fig. 72</b>, the gain across 15 meters is virtually flat. The gain across 20 meters descends, but only moderately, with design emphasis upon performance at the lower end of the band. Although the 10-meter gain curve still ascends, its peak occurs within the pass band. As we discovered with 2-element multi-band quad arrays, element interaction provides 10-meters with higher gain than might otherwise be obtained in a monoband 18' boom quad, since the elements are very widely spaced for that band. 20 meters seems to "suffer" from its relative independence, with 15 meters showing a "balance" of influence. (How to quantify the terms in "-" remains a task for the future of quad design.)</p>

  </center>
  <p>The front-to-back curves (<b>Fig. 73</b>) tell us that the antenna was largely designed for gain, with the source impedance the most important second factor. Front- to-back ratio was largely accepted for what it turned out to be. On 15 meters, where gain performance is exceptionally stable, the front-to-back peak can easily be moved within the passband. 20 and 10 are harder nuts to crack, and their numbers are relatively poor, except for the low end of 20 meters, where they approach being adequate. On 10, the front-to-back performance across the band is similar to a 2-element reflector-driver Yagi.</p>

  </center>
  <p>The 50-Ohm SWR performance of the antennas has also been optimized for the low ends of the bands, as is readily apparent in <b>Fig. 74</b>. On 20 and 10, the SWR is below 2:1 for at least 80% of the pass bands, but that figure goes down to 60% on 10 meters. For reference, here are the standard figures across each of the wide bands.</p>

  <p>Optimizing gain within the pass band for each of the wide bands has resulted in an expansion of the range of reactance across the bands. Like most 3-element parasitical arrays, the lowest impedance is at the upper end of the band.</p>
  <p>We might accept the 20-15 meter performance as not likely to be improved by more than a small amount due to the limitations of the boom length on those bands. Compared to Yagis, the boom length is short for 20 meters and about right for 15 meters, relative to maximizing gain through the use of three elements. Extending and improving 10 meter performance seems the only further development possible, since the boom is long for 3 elements on that band. The 10' reflector-driver spacing seems especially long.</p>
  <h3>A 3/4-Element 5-Band 18'-Boom Quad Array</h3>ON7NQ added a new spreader midway between the old reflector and driver spreaders. To this, he attached what became driver loops for 10 and 12 meters, with the old drivers becoming first directors. The result is a hybrid 3- and 4-element quad, where the element spacing on the highest two bands more closely resembles that used with comparable Yagis. The overall 18' boom length was retained. The result looks something the sketch in <b>Fig. 75</b>.

  <p>Due to the difference in space on 12 and 10 in terms of fractions of a wavelength, the forwardmost director on 12 is actually larger than the first director. Many of the loop size changes are small on the lower bands, and the 15 meter dimensions did not change at all. Here is the model description for this 68-wire, 724-segment model.</p>

  <p>To see what basic improvements the addition of the two new drivers has made, let's look at the midband performance reports from the model.</p>

  <p>Overall, gain and front-to-back ratios are up across the board, although only marginally on the lowest bands. Mid-band gain and front-to-back ratio are better on 10 meters especially. 15-meters remains virtually unchanged.</p>

  </center>
  <p>In the gain curves in <b>Fig. 76</b>, we may note that 15 remains unchanged in its flat curve, while the decrease in gain at the upper end of 20 meters has decreased. The gain curve for 10 meters remains at about 9 dBi or better for 90% of the pass band, before taking a nose dive.</p>

  </center>
  <p>In <b>Fig. 77</b>, we can see the unchanged 15-meter front-to-back curve, which serves as a back drop for the other curves. 20 meters shows a movement of the curve to better center it within the band and give better upper band- edge performance. The biggest improvement occurs on 10 meters, where the front-to-back value is at least 15 dB for more than 3/4 of the pass band. As with the gain, we get a steep slope downward as the frequency approaches 29 MHz.</p>

    <img src="quad-78.gif" width="644" height="526" border="2" vspace="5" hspace="9">
  </center>
  <p>The small adjustments to the lower bands yield 50-Ohm SWR curves (<b>Fig. 78</b>) that are below 2:1 for 90% of 20 and 15 meters. The 10-meter 2:1 curve has been extended to over 80% of the pass band and is consistent with the patterning of the gain and front-to-back figures. 28.8 to 29 MHz has been sacrificed for optimized performance at the low and middle regions of the pass band. You may compare this figure with <b>Fig. 74</b> to more clearly see the improvement in the 50-Ohm SWR category.</p>
  <p>It is also noteworthy to compare the performance figures of the 3/4-element 5-band quad with those of the traditional design in <b>Fig. 68</b> through <b>Fig. 70</b>. Although the 4-element, 40' boom design provides more gain on 15 and 10 meters, the 18' boom 3/4-element design is superior in all other categories, except perhaps 20-meter front-to-back ratio--which was obtained at the cost of a relatively low gain figure over most of the band. The 18' 3/4-element design is also a better match on every band.</p>
  <p>The results of looking at these models are a few suggestions rather than judgments. First, element interaction in a multi-band quad array remains a strong candidate for being the source of some of its performance. The fact that the current ON7NQ model achieves the performance it does with a boom less than 50% the length of the more traditional models suggests that some of the element interactions can be beneficial.</p>
  <p>The achievements of the short boom quad also suggest that those interested in quad design may wish to rethink some of presumptions underlying traditional designs. Element spacing taken in terms of fractions of a wavelength plays a role in optimizing performance, although not necessarily in a simple way. Simply adding element collections at somewhat arbitrary points along the boom may be less effective than optimizing the spacing for each major band and then working out whatever compromises may be needed. A 40' boom may be both useful and necessary for higher gain on 20 and 17, but without intermediate elements somewhere along the line, the boom length may be wasted for 10- and 12-meter performance.</p>
  <p>Even within the realm of these design suggestions, it appears that a quad can be designed for a relatively uniform source impedance for all of the bands covered. Although this feature may not improve absolute performance, it can ease the task of installation, band-switching, and other functions of a more practical nature in constructing and using a large quad array. It also appears possible to better center the SWR curve within both the 20- and 15-meter bands.</p>
  <p>There may in fact be designs available that achieve all of this. My small sample of models can make no claim to being exhaustive or even representative. However, if those designs are not available at present, then multi-band quad designers have a fertile field of endeavor for some time to come. If someone is going to erect something of the mechanical complexity of a many-element, many-band quad, he deserves to have the optimal performance to be gained from the array--and from the investment he has made in it and in its supporting structure.</p>
  <h3>Stacking the 3/4-Element 5-Band 18'-Boom Quad Array</h3>
  <p>The ON7NQ 3/4 element quad on an 18' boom has attracted a bit of attention, along with questions about stacking a pair of them. Stacking quads is not quite the same as stacking Yagis. For identical monoband Yagis, the best stacking distance tends to increase with individual array gain. Once you find--via models--the best distance apart for maximum gain, then the next hunt is for the distance that gives adequate front-to-back ratio--unless one wishes to redesign the antennas in the array. The higher the gain of the individual Yagis, the more likely it is to be able to find a distance that maximizes front-to-back ratio while only robbing about 0.1 dB from the maximum gain.</p>
  <p>For quads, we have a different ball game. Although array gain does play a role in the determination of the best stacking distance, this criterion tends to be overridden by considerations of array isolation. By isolation, I mean a stacking distance that allows each array on all bands covered to shows the least changes in feedpoint impedance on each band relative to a single array. Planar arrays tend to show more isolation at close spacings (5/8 to 2/3 wavelength on 20 meters, or about 24') than spider designs. 2-element 5-band spiders tend to achieve satisfactory isolation with a center-to-center spacing of about 30'--at least in the models explored so far. (Remember that all of this work is exploratory.)</p>
  <p>The ON7NQ array is planar in design, but has more gain than the 2-element planar designs examined so far. Hence, it was likely that the best stacking distance might be more than 24'. In fact, a 30' spacing produced adequate isolation (and convergence of the feedpoint impedances with the single array values). However, 36' proved to be a bit far apart, as the lower-band front-to-back ratio began to decreae--or shift off of the design frequency. Therefore, the following preliminary figures for the single array and the stack in free space use a 30' stack spacing, as measured from the hub of one array to the hub of the other. <b>Fig. 78a</b> shows a profile of the stack.</p>

  <p>The data consists of gain in dBi, TO angle (where relevant), F-B, beamwidth, feed Z(s) and 50-Ohm SWR (for which the original array had been set). Since the array was designed for 28.0 to 28.8 MHz coverage on 10 meters, The values for that band follow the designer's plan.</p>

  <p>The two quad arrays show good isolation with a 30' spacing in free space, shifting the feedpoint impedance by only a very few Ohms on 20 and much less as the frequency goes up. Front-to-back figures remain roughly centered in the design frequencies. The stacking gain shows a relatively standard progression. Consequently, the stacking process may in some cases--considering mast stresses, mechanical complexity, and weather effects--be a worthwhile project. Greater spacing will show increased array isolation on 20 meters, but greater skewing of the performance curves. Less spacing shows decreased isolation between arrays and higher differentials between feedpoint impedance values for the two feedpoints. For reference, the forward gain of a 5-6 element Yagi on a 0.7 wavelength boom (48' on 20 meters, 24' on 10 meters) is about 10.1 dBi in free space.</p>
  <p>Above ground, as we might expect, the values of impedance diverge more than in free space (where Z1 is the lower quad and Z2 is the upper and both quads are fed on the bottom wires of their respective drivers). With 30' spacing, the values--even on the lowest bands--do not diverge enough to materially affect a junction. 75-Ohm quarter wavelength sections might be used on each band and join at a Tee prior to connection to a single remote band switch installed on the mast. If connection length is a problem, the lower quad might be fed at its top wire, and 75-Ohm 3/4 wavelength sections are also usable, although with greater losses. Alternatively, but with some complexities of switching, 75-Ohm parallel line can be used to transform the 50-Ohm individual feed impedances to the 100 Ohms needed at each Tee-junction for the stack common feedline.</p>
  <p>The stacking exercise is shown only as a representative example of possibilities and to illustrate the importance of independence or isolation in quad stacking.</p>
