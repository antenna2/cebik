    <li><b><i>Basic Antenna Modeling: A Hands-On Tutorial</i></b> is a step-by-step course in modeling with NEC-2, including well over 100 different exercise models with numerous variations. There are many exercises for student entries, with check-tables to confirm the results.</li>
    <li><b><i>Intermediate Antenna Modeling: A Hands-On Tutorial</i></b> provides over 450 pages of illustrated text and about 300 exercise models and variants as a means of introducing virtually the entire command sets of both NEC-2 and NEC-4. The self-study course is designed for use in conjunction with advanced software packages. The major division are The Geometry Commands; Far-Field and General Control Commands; and Special Outputs, Control Commands, and Techniques.

It examines in detail the concepts of soil conductivity and relative permittivity, as well as providing what NEC-4 modelxs report about a large number of questions, including the number of radials, their length and depth, the effects of monopole height above them. the use of insulated wire, the the effects of frequency. As well, the volume answers a number of modeling questions, from how to set up radial system models to the adequacy of substitutes for buried radials, such as the use of near-ground radial NEC-2 models and the use of a MININEC ground system. In addition, the volume treats elevated radial system for the lower HF, upper HF, and VHF/IHF ranges.<br>

    <li><b><i>Long-Boom Yagi Studies</i></b>: This large CDROM volume explores many series of long-boom Yagis from 2 to 14 wavelengths, including the classic DL6WU series and others, with a sequence of optimized Yagis in the same range provided by N6BV. The aim is to replace the scattered sampling of specific designs with systematic data from many series of Yagis, element-by-element, to find the data trends. The work covers single units and vertical stacks of 2, spaced either for maximum gain or for the best combination of sidelobe suppression. The volume also includes a 14 wavelength long Yagi with 20-dB sidelobe attenuation for almost the entire 70-cm band. Appendices contain sweep graphs for almost all of the Yagi series, element by element, and 360 EZNEC models used as the basis for data generation.</li><br>

      <b><i><a href="../books/Longwire-Notes.pdf">Long Wire Notes</a></i></b>: Long-wire technology may be ancient, but it still has much to teach about the behavior of directional antennas. This volume covers single (straight) long wires, V arrays, and rhombics in both terminated and unterminated forms. The latter forms are among the first traveling-wave and frequency-independent antennas. Although the book makes constant reference to classical references in the field, it uses modern computer antenna modeling software to refresh the analysis, check older design data, and establish some facts about long-wire antennas that lay outside the boundaries of early calculations. The book also provides details and cautions on modeling certain forms of long-wire antennas, especially multi-wire terminated rhombic designs.<br>

    <li><b><i><a href="../books/LPDA-Notes-Vol-2.pdf">LPDA Notes - Volume 2: Hybrid LPDAs</a></i></b>: Volume 2 begins with a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various traditional and long-boom designs for the log-cell Yagi. Part 3 explores a number of practical LPDAs, including lower HF vs. UHF designs, narrow-band vs. very wide-band designs, and split-band vs. continuous-band designs.</li><br>
    <li><b><i>LPDA Notes - Volume 3: A Potpourri of LPAs</i></b>: Volume 3 begins with astudy of shorted stubs used with LPDAs with a following exploration of the patterns of element currents. Part 2 examines LPDA predecessors, the 2-bat zigzag LPA to determine its capabilities relative to LPDAs. Part 2 examines the potential of extended aperture LPDAs (EALPDAs, while the last section explores the V-element LPDA and the log-spiral LPA.</li><br>

    <li><b><i>Planar and Corner Reflector Arrays</i></b>: Resting on optical rather than parasitic or phased-element principles, planar (flat) and corner reflectors suffer undeserved neglect by a large portion of the amateur community (and others). The planar reflector turns out to have an ideal size based on the size of the driver, which can be simple or complex. Corner reflectors accept fewer driver variations, but are capable of high performance levels, although rod-based and screen-based reflectors have interesting differences. The book includes information of 3-dimensional reflectors as well as on the more standard 2-dimensional corner reflector.</li><br>
    <li>
      <b><i><a href="../books/SCV-Notes.pdf">Self Contained Vertical Notes</a></i></b>: Nearly a decade has gone by, and I still receive questions about these interesting antennas. Therefore, I decided to return to ground zero and re-formulate the information in those articles and much, much more to create this volume. I have expanded coverage in terms of several factors: the fundamentals upon which SCVs operate, antenna types that fit within the group, frequency coverage, and special applications and opportunities.<br>

      <b><i><a href="../books/Some-Basics-of-Multi-Band-Beam-Design.pdf">Some Basics of Multi-Band Beam Design</a></i></b>: There is among some amateur radio beam designers a special art: the art, since, and craft of designing multi-band parasitic beams. Sometimes the work of an individual, sometimes the work of a team, designing directional antennas that cover more than one amateur band is not as easy as it may seem on the surface. We cannot simply interlace a collection of monoband beams, since all of the off- band elements will be active, at least at a low level, on all bands. The interactions are sufficient to complicate the process of deriving on all bands adequate gain, respectable front-to-back ratios, clean radiation patterns, and an acceptable feedpoint impedance.<br>

      <b><i><a href="../books/Two-Ele-Horizontal-Beams-Vol-1-Phased-Arrays.pdf">Two Element Horizontal Beams Volume 1 - Phased Arrays</a></i></b>: If one element is good, then two must be better. This credo underlies most amateur understanding of 2-element (and n-element) arrays. In Volume 1 of this set, we explore the nature and types of 2-element directional and bi-directional phased arrays. We call an array phased when we provide energy directly to each element in the array.<br>

      <b><i><a href="../books/Two-Ele-Horizontal-Beams-Vol-2-Parasitic-Arrays.pdf">Two Element Horizontal Beams Volume 2 - Parasitic Arrays</a></i></b>: Feeding a single element creates the most popular form of 2-element array. This longer look results in a completely new volume because there are so many variations on the basic 2 element parasitic scheme. Of course, we call an array parasitic when we feed one element (usually) and allow the other elements to arrive at the conditions for directional service solely by the mutual coupling between elements.<br>
