  <p>The 1930's list from the <i><b>American Radio Relay League Handbook</b></i> is only a partial listing of Q-signals, even at that early date. Like lists in more current ARRL handbooks and operating manuals, the 1930 list contains only those signals thought to be of most use to radio amateurs.</p>
  <p>A later (world War II) listing is fairly common among CW fans. My copy of the <i><b>Combined Operating Signals</b></i>, a joint U.S.-British production, dates from 1944 and contains only Q-signals, omitting the Z- series and, of course, ARRL's later N- series. My thanks to VE3DNY for sending me a photocopy. Virtually the entire set of combinations appears, with only a few left blank for future use. Each signal is listed twice: once on a left-hand alphabetical listing page and again on a right-hand topical page. The system begins to fold back upon itself. For example, QQP means "Check correctness of last QDR given." This is opaque unless one knows that QDR means "Your magnetic bearing in relation to me is xxx." However opaque the system may seem, the document contains the following warning: "These operating signals possess no security and must be regarded as equivalent to plain language. This must be borne in mind by all users and great care must be taken to avoid giving away information of value to the enemy." The enemy that the authors of the manual had in mind was NOT users of telephony in any of its forms or even non-hams.</p>
