  <p>As I retired and cleaned out an office of some 26 years' use, I uncovered a number of antique nuggets. I wished they had been gold and convertible into cash, but alas, they were only wisdom encapsulated. Some are more than 25 years in my possession--and may have been old when I received them. Their ultimate origins are wholly unknown, since my sources are burred photocopies of nearly as blurry photocopies. While my sight remains good enough to decipher them, I shall place them here. Read at your own peril.</p>

  <h3>Understanding Scientific and Technical Discussion and Literature</h3>The following list speaks for itself--and, unfortunately, for all too many of us upon occasion. Let he or she who has never used any of these expressions (or their first cousins) cast the first aspersion.

  <h3>Buzz-Wordsmanship</h3>After recently distributing the "Keys to Understanding Scientific Discussion and Literature," I received a wonderful array of appreciative notes, equally divided between those who vaguely remembered the list and welcomed an old friend and those who had never before seen it and felt guilty for having used a column-1 expression on at least one occasion. Two separate sources sent me copies of another item originating at the same time (about a quarter century ago, I think, and likely even older--I cannot be sure because I wore out my copy using it). While equally fascinating, it had more to do with administration and management than it did with electronics of the sort that interests us.
  <p>However, if necessity is the mother of invention, then play is surely the father. So let's review the original item and then see what electronic damage we may do to it.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

    <b>How To Win At Wordsmanship</b>
  </center>
  <p>After years of hacking through etymological thickets at the U.S. Public Health Service, a 63-year-old official named Philip Broughton hit upon a sure-fire method for converting frustration into fulfillment (jargonwise). Euphemistically called the Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector, Broughton's system employs a lexicon of 30 carefully chosen "buzzwords":</p>
  <pre>Column 1                 Column 2                 Column 3

0.  integrated           0.  management           0.  options
1.  total                1.  organizational       1.  flexibility
2.  systematized         2.  monitored            2.  capability
3.  parallel             3.  reciprocal           3.  mobility
4.  functional           4.  digital              4.  programming
5.  responsive           5.  logistical           5.  concept
6.  optional             6.  transitional         6.  time-phase
7.  synchronized         7.  incremental          7.  projection
8.  compatible           8.  third-generation     8.  hardware
9.  balanced             9.  policy               9.  contingency</pre>
  <p>The procedure is simple. Think of any three digit number, then select the corresponding buzzword from each column. For instance, number 257 produces "systematized logistical projection," a phrase that can be dropped into virtually any report with that ring of decisive, knowledgeable authority. "No one will have the remotest idea of what you are talking about," says Broughton, "but the important thing is that they're not about to admit it."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p>Two facts struck me. First, every ham wishes he or she could come up with the key electronic invention that would solve the world's problems, make one rich beyond belief, and write one's name large in all future history books. Second, all that is needed is inspiration.</p>
  <p>Since the first premise is set, all we need is a source of inspiration. That's where Broughton's word-play device comes into play. By judiciously selecting words for 3 columns, we can inspire ourselves to create the electronics of tomorrow. So I made up my list of inspirational concepts.</p>
  <pre>Column 1                 Column 2                 Column 3

0.  integrated           0.  encoded              0.  optimizer
1.  asynchonous          1.  programmable         1.  converter
2.  analog               2.  monitored            2.  reactor
3.  parallel             3.  reciprocal           3.  transducer
4.  functional           4.  demodulated          4.  interface
5.  transferable         5.  logic-based          5.  buffer
6.  digital              6.  transformational     6.  filter
7.  synchronized         7.  incremental          7.  instrument
8.  compatible           8.  fifth-generation     8.  regenerator
9.  balanced             9.  time-phase           9.  generator</pre>
  <p>Be careful: some 3-digit inventions may already exist, such as 654. However, I have never seen a 770 or a 334. You may revise the list to suit your special interests. But there is fertile inventive ground, even in this preliminary cut. So while you rewrite the list, I am off to the shop. I do not know today if I shall try to make an 898 or a 542.</p>

  <h3>Mastering the Grammar of Technical and Scientific Literature</h3>
  <p>The third (and final?) entry is a set of general guidelines sufficient to lead anyone through the grammatical morass of technical writing. Specialists try to make the task seem more difficult than it is, but the following rules cover almost all of the cases you will encounter in a lifetime of writing and editing. Again, the exact origin is unknown, although the list has been plaguarized many times. One more time will likely not hurt.</p>
  <center>
    <b>Rules of English for Technical Article, Proposal, and Report Writers</b>
  </center>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Don't use no double negatives.</li>
    <li>2. Make each pronoun agree with their antecedent.</li>
    <li>3. Join clauses good, like a conjunction should.</li>
    <li>4. About them sentence fragments.</li>
    <li>5. When dangling, watch them participles.</li>
    <li>6. Verbs has to agree with their subject.</li>
    <li>7 Just between you and I, case is important, too.</li>
    <li>8. Don't write run-on sentences they are hard to read.</li>
    <li>9. Don't use commas, which are not necessary.</li>
    <li>10. Try to not ever split infinitives.</li>
    <li>11. Its important to use your apostrophe's correctly.</li>
    <li>12. Proofread your writing to see if you any words out.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Enough is enough. Or is it. . .?</p>
