Periodicals of Interest to QRP Enthusiasts                 Version 2.0
                                                          July 1, 1999
Compiled by L. B. Cebik, W4RNL

Contents:  This file contains basic information on periodicals of
especial interest to QRP enthusiasts.  It lists club-sponsored and
subscription periodicals that are of wide interest to QRPers
world-wide and that are readily available.

NOT included are standard, general interest amateur radio journals,
such as QST, CQ, Communications Quarterly, 73, RADCOM, and others from
all over the world.  Although these journals often contain articles of
interest to QRP enthusiasts, they are too well known to require space
here.  World Radio and FISTs have regular QRP columns.

Electronics books and antenna books of interest to QRP enthusiasts
will be found in two separate listings.

Each entry in this list providess the following information:  journal
name, issues per year, source, cost per year, basis of subscription,
average pages per issue, subscription or membership address, a brief
description of the usual contents, and special notes.

This list is believed to be reasonably complete and accurate as of the
date of this notice.  Corrections and additions may be e-mailed to me
at the listed address.  I shall be pleased to add to the list any
publication omitted if it is of high interest to QRP operators and
builders.  And, of course, I shall be pleased to correct any errors
and update the information listed.

Permission to reproduce this list is hereby granted on condition that
a full reference to its source is included.

Good reading, good building, and good operating to you.

                                                    L. B. Cebik, W4RNL
