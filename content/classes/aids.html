  <p>Antenna modeling via method-of-moments and related software has become a major part of antenna design and analysis activity at every level of effort, from amateur radio to professional research and engineering. Although software is widely available, education in the effective use of these computer aids has been lacking. Part of my effort to remedy this difficulty has included a monthly column in <i><b>antenneX</b></i> called simply <b><a href="../amod/modeling.html">Antenna Modeling</a></b>.</p>
  <p>To further assist antenna modelers, I have prepared some other materials which are available from commercial sources. The list of links below will more fully describe each item and provide additional links to places where the items may be obtained.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../images/colorbar.gif" width="540" height="4"></p><br>
  <p><b><i><a href="../../books/Basic-Antenna-Modeling.pdf">Basic Antenna Modeling: A Hands-On Tutorial</a></i></b>.</p>
  <p>A sizable volume of 21 chapters introducing antenna modeling in NEC-2. Written to accompany the Nittany-Scientific NEC-Win Plus software implementation of NEC-2, the principles of modeling presented by the book are nonetheless perfectly general. The book is designed to be used in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from self-study to short-courses and seminars to formal college classroom instruction in antenna modeling. Accompanying the book is a disk of antenna models for the 150+ exercises to give the user detailed hands-on experience and guidance in model construction for a wide variety of antennas. The title link provides further information on the book, as well as a link to Nittany-Scientific for pricing and ordering.</p>
  <p><b><i><a href="../../books/Intermediate-Antenna-Modeling.pdf">Intermediate Antenna Modeling: A Hands-On Tutorial</a></i></b></p>
  <p>Provides over 450 pages of illustrated text and about 300 exercise models and variants as a means of introducing virtually the entire command sets of both NEC-2 and NEC-4. The self-study course is designed for use in conjunction with advanced software packages. The major division are The Geometry Commands; Far-Field and General Control Commands; and Special Outputs, Control Commands, and Techniques.<br>
  <br></p>
  <p><i><b><a href="../../books/Basic-Intermediate-Tutorial-Models.zip">Exercise Models in EZNEC and NEC Format</a></b></i></p>
  <p>Some modelers may wish to use <i><b>Basic Antenna Modeling</b></i> with EZNEC software, which uses a proprietary format for model files. Therefore, I have prepared a disk of the exercise files in the .EZ format. The disk contains all 150+ exercises, with variants used in the exercises, for a total of over 350 model files. The disk may also be used as a sampling of some of the many types of MF to UHF antennas that one may model with NEC-2. The title link provides fuller information on the disk, including a link to the source of purchase and a partial list of the models included.</p>

  <p><b><a href="models.html"><i>Models for Antenna Modelers in .EZ and .NEC Formats: 2nd Edition</i></a></b></p>
  <p>There has been a need for exemplary models for newer antenna modelers to use to gain experience. As well, experienced modelers have no wish to reinvent models already in existence. To serve both groups, I have gleaned--from my accumulation of over 4000 models--sets of models that may serve as a foundation for modelers to build upon. Each set in the second edition consists of over 100 models focused around a central antenna category. The available sets (which contain the same models in both .EZ and .NEC formats) are these:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>102 HF Yagis</li>
    <li>130 HF and VHF Quads</li>
    <li>111 HF-UHF LPDAs</li>
    <li>103 Vertical and Horizontal Phased Arrays</li>
    <li>103 HF Horizontal Wire Antennas/Arrays</li>
    <li>108 HF and VHF Vertical Antennas/Arrays</li>
    <li>144 VHF/UHF Antennas</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The title link provides fuller information on the content of each set and a download link at the bottom of the page.</p>
