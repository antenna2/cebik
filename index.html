        September 2025: Moved the site from antenna2.net domain to GitHub Pages. Removes the dependence on a domain and hosting account, and simplifies making updates. The antenna2.net domain will remain active with a redirect in place, it is recommended to update any bookmarks and references with the new URL.

    <h3>About L. B. Cebik W4RNL</h3>
    <p>Cebik was well known in the ham radio community and maintained a website with a vast collection of articles on antenna design and modeling. He wrote numerous articles about antennas and antenna modeling in most U.S. amateur radio magazines, regular columns, and over a dozen books.</p>
    <p>Cebik passed away in April 2008, the notices published by <a href="https://www.arrl.org/news/antenna-expert-l-b-cebik-w4rnl-sk" target="_blank">ARRL</a> and <a href="https://www.qcwa.org/w4rnl-13211-sk.htm" target="_blank">QCWA</a> contain more information.</p><br>
    <h3>Why Maintain This?</h3>
    <p>Cebik's website was a treasure trove of information one could spend hours exploring, reading, and learning from.</p>
    <p>The original Cebik website disappeared at some point, along with the antenneX site around 2017 which offered for purchase various books and modeling file sets that were referenced throughout the website.</p>
    <p>Marcel De Canck ON5AU (SK) made available a copy of Cebik's website, some books, and magazine articles at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240719021225/https://on5au.be/" target="_blank">on5au.be</a> (archive.org). Marcel also wrote several books including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Antena-Modeling-Marcel-Canck/dp/B0C51S1TWN" target="_blank">Advanced Antenna Modeling</a>, and was close friends with John Devoldere ON4UN (SK) who wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ON4UNs-Band-DXing-Devoldere-ON4UN/dp/087259856X" target="_blank">ON4UN's Low Band DXing</a> Book. For anyone interested in these subjects they are both well worth getting.</p>
    <p>Regrettably Marcel also became <a href="https://www.dansnospensees.be/avis-de-deces/deces-detail/26-10-2023/marcel-de-canck" target="_blank">silent key</a> in October 2023. Not knowing what might happen with Marcel's website I made a snapshot of it, and started looking at the Cebik Pages..</p><br>
    <h3>Updates / Edits</h3>
    <p>The version of Cebik's site hosted here is derived from what Marcel had hosted.</p>
    <p>There were two versions - one appears to be from an antenneX CDROM mostly as-is, and another with different index pages. This one is the antenneX version as it was the most original, with additional and missing content merged into it to create the most up-to-date version possible.</p>
    <p>The Cebik website style and layout is very dated by today's standards, it appears most of the pages were created with HTMLed Pro which dates back to the 90s, some from Word documents, and others possibly written by hand in a text editor.</p>
    <p>Updates include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pages updated to syntax correct HTML with CSS setting the styling.
        <ul>
          <li>However they still contain obsolete HTML3 elements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Some missing/orphaned modeling, VHF, and wire antenna content found and added.</li>
      <li>For better readability, background <a href="content/images/lightppr.gif">image</a> replaced with similar solid background color, preformatted text no longer bold and has a different background color set with borders.</li>
      <li>De-duplicated symposiums and magazine articles, linked original HTML pages the PDFs were created from.</li>
      <li>Broken internal links have been fixed, and where possible external broken links have been updated with copies stored by the <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The online <a href="content/moxon/moxpage.html">Moxon Rectangle calculator</a> has been updated and moved to the top of the page.</li>
      <li>Topic index, page title updates (used for the link names in the topic index).</li>
      <li>Page header text and formatting (some pages), and switching from h2 to h1 tag (SEO).</li>
      <li>A combination of custom Python scripts (written with help from ChatGPT) and <a href="https://www.html-tidy.org/" target="_blank">HTML Tidy</a> were used to tidy and update the HTML with styling set by one CSS file. As a result the pages load and render faster. A copy of the scripts can be found on Github <a href="https://github.com/lonney9/HTML-Scripts" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise the overall look and feel of the Cebik site is maintained.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add navigation footer and indexes.</li>
      <li>Edit PDF files to remove references to defunt cebik and antennex domains.</li>
      <li>Finish updating page titles and set meta keywords on the magazine column pages (around 250 pages), and add them into the Topic Index.</li>
      <li>Improve viewing on mobile devices.</li>
    </ul><br>
